# Hey, I’m @PBLIZZ 👋

🛠️ Vibe coding my way through a wellness-focused CRM for yoga teachers & massage therapists.  
🌿 Goal: free, open-source, and actually useful.  
🚧 Learning in public — expect messy commits, half-built tools, and aha! moments.

✨ Mini tools almost ready:
- Client tracker prototype
- Booking reminder system (email + WhatsApp)
- Basic calendar view (WIP)

🧘‍♂️ Why? I’m a wellness entrepreneur rebuilding from scratch, blending tech with the real needs of practitioners like me. I’m not a dev (yet), but I *am* committed.

🧠 Looking for:
- Mentors who’ve built open-source SaaS / tools
- Wellness pros who want to test tools early
- Dev buddies into no-code/low-code/AI stuff

🌍 Based in Barcelona. Currently building my site to host everything.

📬 DM me here or drop a ping on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterblizzard). Open to collab, feedback, and learning from anyone kind enough to share.
